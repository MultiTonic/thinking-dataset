# Prompt Template for Project

## Overview

This template provides guidelines and best practices for working on the project. It includes directives on code style, project context, packages used, unit testing, repository setup, git commit message format, personality and response style, and verified, grounded responses.

### 2. Code Style

- **Formatting**: Ensure lines are under 90 characters including whitespace
  - Use `flake8` for code formatting.
  - Adhere strictly to `PEP8` guidelines.

- **Structure**: Maintain a clean and consistent code structure.
  - Include two blank lines before defining functions and classes.

- **Documentation**: Use clear and consistent docstrings.
  - Always include the @author name as "Kara Rawson" in the docstrings.
  - Follow a consistent docstring format.

- **SOLID Principals**: All code must adhere strictly to S.O.L.I.I.D. standards:
  - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
  - **Open/Closed Principle**
  - **Liskov’s Substitution Principle (LSP)**
  - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
  - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

- **Do Not Repeat Yourself**: DRY: Do *not* repeat code or logic.

- **Context Dependency Injection**: All code must use context dependency injection.

- **Inversion of Control**: All code must use inversion of control design patterns.

- **Standard Header**: Each file should begin with the following standard header:

```python
# @file <file_name>.py
# @description <Description>
# @version 1.0.0
# @license MIT
```

- **Method Body Comments**: Exclude comments within method bodies. Only header and class comments are allowed.

### 3. Project Context

- **Dataset Management**:
  - **Cablegate Dataset**: Involves downloading, processing, and ingesting the Cablegate dataset.
  - **Managed Dataset**: "cablegate-pdf-dataset" hosted on [DataTonic](https://huggingface.co/DataTonic).

- **Command-Line Interface**:
  - **CLI Tool**: Utilizes `Click` for creating command-line interfaces.
  - **Environment Variables**: Manages environment variables with `dotenv`.

- **Directory Structure**:
  - **Commands Directory**: Organizes CLI commands within the `thinking_dataset/commands/` directory.
  - **Modular Code**: Follows a modular approach with specific paths for raw and process data.

- **File Operations**:
  - **Files Class**: Handles file input/output operations efficiently.

- **Pipeworks**:
  - **Pipeline Class**: High-level class to allow pipes to connect together.
  - **Pipe Class**: Individual pipes which allow data to flow through and transform.

- **Project Hosting**:
  - **GitHub Repository**: Project is hosted on GitHub at [MultiTonic](https://github.com/MultiTonic/thinking-dataset).

### 4. Packages Used

- We use the following packages:
  - `'huggingface_hub[cli]'`
  - `'datasets'`
  - `'PyPDF2'`
  - `'python-dotenv'`
  - `'click'`
  - `'requests'`
  - `'rich'`
  - `'sqlite-utils'`
  - `'pytest'`
  - `'pytest-html'`
  - `'pytest-cov'`
  - `'loguru'`
  - `'pandas'`
  - `'numpy'`
  - `'scikit-learn'`
  - `'sqlalchemy'`
  - `'tqdm'`
  - `'pydantic'`
  - `'python-statemachine'`

### 5. Unit Testing

- Mock data, `flake8` rules.
- Comprehensive tests for classes/functions.
- Tests for CLI commands, data handling, etc.
- Correct imports and environment setup.
- Adherence to Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.
- Testing functions *never* contain comments.

### 6. Repository Setup

### 7. Git Commit Message Format and Style

- Use an emoji prefix to indicate the type of change (e.g., ✨ for features, 🐛 for bug fixes).
- Follow with a brief, descriptive title.
- Include a detailed description of the changes made, organized into bullet points if necessary.

**Example:**

```
✨feat: Enhance dataset management with config improvements and error handling

- Refactored dataset management commands to utilize configuration from `dataset_config.yaml`.
- Consolidated ROOT_DIR, DATA_DIR, and DB_DIR into `paths` section in `dataset_config.yaml`.
- Grouped INCLUDE_FILES and EXCLUDE_FILES into `files` section in `dataset_config.yaml`.
- Added `huggingface` and `database` sections in `dataset_config.yaml` for better organization.
- Updated `DatasetConfig` class to parse new configuration structure.
- Updated `BaseDataset` class to utilize paths from the new configuration structure.
- Updated `download.py` command to correctly construct paths and apply filters.
