## Overview

This template documents the recent changes and improvements made to the project from yesterday until now. It includes refactoring, new features, added tests, and updates to documentation.

## Changes Summary

### Enhancements and Refactoring

1. **Files Worked On**:
   - `thinking_dataset/commands/clean.py`
   - `thinking_dataset/commands/download.py`
   - `thinking_dataset/commands/load.py`
   - `thinking_dataset/commands/prepare.py`
   - `thinking_dataset/io/files.py`
   - `thinking_dataset/utilities/command_utils.py`
   - `thinking_dataset/pipeworks/pipes/normalize_text_pipe.py`
   - `thinking_dataset/config/dataset_config.yaml`
   - `thinking_dataset/utilities/text_utils.py`
   - `thinking_dataset/pipelines/pipeline.py`

2. **Implemented Comprehensive Text Normalization**:
   - Added `NormalizeTextPipe` class to handle text normalization tasks:
     - Convert text to lowercase
     - Expand contractions
     - Remove separators and special characters
     - Normalize numbers and space-separated characters
     - Remove partial extract intros, section headers, and sign-offs
     - Remove initial patterns and period patterns
     - Remove headers before the first occurrence of `subject:`
     - Clean unnecessary whitespace

3. **Enhanced `TextUtils` Class**:
   - Added new methods:
     - `expand_contractions`
     - `remove_special_characters`
     - `remove_separators`
     - `remove_whitespace`
     - `normalize_numbers`
     - `normalize_spaced_characters`
     - `remove_partial_extract_intro`
     - `remove_section_headers`
     - `remove_signoff`
     - `remove_initial_pattern`
     - `remove_period_patterns`
     - `remove_header`

4. **Updated Pipeline Configuration**:
   - Included the following pipes:
     - AddIdPipe
     - DropColumnsPipe
     - RemapColumnsPipe
     - RemoveDuplicatesPipe
     - HandleMissingValuesPipe
     - CleanWhitespacePipe
     - NormalizeTextPipe
     - FilterBySizePipe
   - Ensured normalization before filtering by size
   - Added contraction mappings for text normalization

5. **Implemented Logging and Testing**:
   - Implemented logging for tracking the total running time of the pipeline
   - Conducted comprehensive testing to ensure proper text normalization and data cleaning
   - Verified that normalized text fits within LLaMA's 128k context window
   - Ensured all changes align with defined goals and maintain code readability and efficiency

### Fixed

1. **Comprehensive Testing and Logging**:
   - Implemented logging for tracking the total running time of the pipeline
   - Conducted comprehensive testing to ensure proper text normalization and data cleaning
   - Verified that normalized text fits within LLaMA's 128k context window
   - Ensured all changes align with defined goals and maintain code readability and efficiency

1. **Revised and Optimized Prompt Template**:
   - Updated the "Prompt Template for Recent Work" to improve structure and readability:
     - Replaced all mentions of `preprocess` command with `prepare` command
     - Adjusted the order of sections to ensure optimal memory usage
     - Updated "Files Worked On" to include relevant files for `pipeworks` pipeline, dataset configuration, and command enhancements
     - Enhanced the "Notes for Next Session" section to provide clear and actionable tasks
     - Refined the "Overview" section to ensure clear documentation of recent changes and improvements

## Next Steps

1. **Expand the Text Normalization Process**:
   - Continue improving the `NormalizeTextPipe` class to handle additional text normalization tasks as needed.

2. **Write Comprehensive Tests**:
   - Develop and expand unit tests for the `NormalizeTextPipe` and other relevant pipes to ensure their robustness and reliability.

3. **Improve Pipeline Configuration and Error Handling**:
   - Implement and test comprehensive error handling mechanisms within the pipeline.
   - Optimize the pipeline configuration to ensure efficient data processing and normalization.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update the documentation to include recent changes, specifically the enhancements to the `NormalizeTextPipe`.
   - Ensure all changes are clearly documented in the changelog with detailed commit messages.

5. **Review and Refine**:
   - Regularly review the codebase for potential improvements and optimizations.
   - Refine existing functionalities to ensure optimal performance and maintainability.
