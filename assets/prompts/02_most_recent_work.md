   - Ensured all changes align with defined goals and maintain code readability and efficiency.
   - Added logging to confirm the creation of the process directory in `Files` class.

### Fixed

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Updated the `clean` command to check if the data directory exists before attempting to remove it.
   - Added a check to log a message and exit gracefully if the directory does not exist, avoiding FileNotFoundError.
   - Improved logging and error handling to provide clear feedback on the cleanup process.
   - Added handling for `PermissionError` to skip files in use by other processes, with appropriate logging.
   - Addressed `AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'root_path'` issue in `Files` class.
   - Addressed `AttributeError: 'Config' object has no attribute 'get'` issue by accessing attributes directly.

2. **Sorting and Progress Bar Fixes**:
   - Fixed sorting issue in the `multi_thread_apply` method within the `Pipe` class.
   - Added debugging statements to inspect the contents of the `futures` dictionary and `results` list in `Pipe` class.
   - Ensured the `results` list is properly sorted based on the `futures` keys in `Pipe` class.
   - Verified the functionality of the `multi_thread_apply` method to confirm the fix resolves the issue.
   - Initialized and displayed the progress bar immediately with 0% progress in `tqdm`.
   - Updated progress bar at 0.1-second intervals using a background thread.
   - Ensured smoother and more frequent updates during multi-threaded operations in `tqdm`.

### Changed
