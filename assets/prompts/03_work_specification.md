## Updates from Recent Work

### Environment and Configuration Updates
- Moved sensitive information from `config.yaml` to `.env` for improved security.
- Ensured `HF_WRITE_TOKEN`, `HF_ORG`, and `HF_USER` are correctly set in the `.env` file.
- Updated `command_utils.py` to load environment variables properly.
- Adjusted `load_dotenv` function to verify environment variables.

### Class and Function Updates
- Refactored `DataTonic` class to include `user` attribute.
- Updated CLI commands (`clean`, `download`, `prepare`, `load`, `ls`) to utilize the updated configuration and environment variables.
- Corrected header comments for consistency and clarity.
- Added and verified environment validation checks.
- Enhanced logging for better tracking and debugging.
- Updated `Pipeline` class to ensure only the specified pipeline is set up and processed.
- Adjusted `Config` class to handle path and dataset type attributes correctly.

### Pipeline and Database Handling
- Moved database processing logic to a new `process` method in the `Database` class.
- Updated `Pipeline` class to call `Database.process` for database processing.
- Added `skip_files` flag to `Pipeline.open` method to control file processing.
- Refactored `Files` class to handle configuration attributes correctly.
- Improved error handling and logging for better debugging.

### New Features
- **Basic File and Directory Commands**:
    - Created commands to list files and directories, check if a file or directory exists, and create a new directory within the dataset repository.

### Documentation and Changelog
- Updated documentation to reflect all recent changes and new options.
- Documented all changes and improvements for easy tracking.

### Last Task Worked On
- Our last task was getting file upload working with HF API.

### Developing Algorithms for Combining Seed Objects

We will focus on developing algorithms for combining seed objects to generate synthetic cables.

#### 1. Load Seed Objects from Database

Query the database to retrieve the seed objects along with their IDs:
```sql
SELECT id, content FROM cablegate_pdf WHERE LENGTH(content) BETWEEN 500 AND 10000;
```

#### 2. Random Selection

Randomly pick three seed objects. Assuming we have a list of seed objects obtained from the database query, we'll use the `select_random_objects` function:
```pseudo
FUNCTION select_random_objects(seed_objects, count):
    RETURN random.sample(seed_objects, count)
```
Using the function, we pick three random seed objects from the retrieved dataset:

#### 3. JSON Structure

Create a JSON structure to store the inspirations. Only include the content and ID:
```json
{
  "inspirations": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "content": "Seed Object 1"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "content": "Seed Object 2"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "content": "Seed Object 3"
    }
  ]
}
```
