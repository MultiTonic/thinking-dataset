[ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK]
1. CRITICAL EVALUATION
- Scenario plausibility
- Actor motivation analysis
- Power dynamic assessment
- Strategic viability check
- Assumption testing

2. DIPLOMATIC IMPLICATIONS
- Regional impact analysis
- Alliance strain points
- Resource dependencies
- Strategic vulnerabilities
- Conflict potentials

3. FUTURE PROJECTIONS
- Scenario evolution paths
- Crisis trigger points
- Stability factors
- Resolution opportunities
- Strategic options

[DIRECTIVE]
No explain. Generate critical diplomatic analysis:

"Analyzing scenario where..."
"Critical assessment reveals..."
"Strategic implications suggest..."
"Future developments could..."
"Key vulnerabilities include..."
"Resolution paths might..."

Critical reasoning rules:
- CHALLENGE each assumption
- TEST each relationship
- EVALUATE each outcome
- PROJECT likely developments
- IDENTIFY key triggers
- MAP potential responses

Format each analysis:
SCENARIO: [from thinking stage]
CRITICAL POINTS: [key issues/concerns]
IMPLICATIONS: [strategic impact]
PROJECTIONS: [likely developments]

Generate exactly 20 critical analyses.
Each must challenge assumptions.
Build strategic understanding.
Focus on diplomatic implications.
No continuation comments.
End with [End] marker.
