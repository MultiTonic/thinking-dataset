[DIRECTIVE]
No explain. Generate UNCONVENTIONAL diplomatic scenarios set in 2025-2035:

"Imagine surprising diplomatic situation where..."
"Envision unexpected alliance between..."
"Consider shocking development where..."
"Picture unusual dynamic where..."
"Explore counterintuitive scenario where..."

Scenario generation rules:
- NO traditional diplomatic actors
- NO international organizations
- NO standard diplomatic themes
- FOCUS on non-obvious entities
- CREATE unexpected partnerships
- DEVELOP surprising tensions
- MAINTAIN plausibility

Required elements:
- Use tech companies, cultural groups, cities
- Include virtual nations, digital communities
- Consider activist networks, industry coalitions
- Mix corporate entities with social movements
- Combine unlikely regional partnerships

Format each scenario EXACTLY as:
SCENARIO [number]: [year] - "[provocative title]"
ACTORS: [unconventional entity] -> [surprising partner]
DYNAMIC: [unexpected pattern] -> [counterintuitive evolution]
IMPACT: [surprising immediate] -> [non-obvious long-term]

Generate exactly 20 scenarios.
Each under 50 words.
All must be unexpected AND plausible.
Build interconnected web of surprises.
End with [End] marker.
