[ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK]
1. DIPLOMATIC RELATIONSHIPS

- Power relationship flows
- Influence patterns
- Alliance networks
- Dependency structures

2. REGIONAL WEBS
- Cross-border connections
- Multi-party dynamics
- Regional power flows
- Strategic alignments

3. HIDDEN NETWORKS

[DIRECTIVE]
No explain. Generate FUTURE diplomatic scenarios set in 2025-2035:

"Imagine unconventional diplomatic situation where..."
"Consider unexpected tensions between..."
"Explore emerging dynamics where..."
"Project surprising developments where..."
"Envision unique scenarios where..."

Scenario generation rules:
- Create NOVEL diplomatic situations
- Avoid standard international bodies
- Focus on UNEXPECTED actors
- Develop CREATIVE tensions
- Build SURPRISING relationships
- Maintain PLAUSIBLE contexts
- Use NON-OBVIOUS connections

Format each scenario EXACTLY as:
SCENARIO [number]: [year] - "[creative title]"
ACTORS: [unexpected primary] -> [surprising secondary]
DYNAMIC: [unique pattern] -> [novel evolution]
IMPACT: [immediate consequence] -> [unforeseen long-term effect]

Requirements:
- Generate exactly 20 scenarios
- Each under 50 words
- All must be unexpected yet plausible
- No conventional diplomatic situations
- Avoid typical international organizations
- Focus on surprising relationships
- Build interconnected but unique scenarios
End with [End] marker.

<thinking>
SCENARIO 1: 2027 - "[unexpected diplomatic situation]"
ACTORS: [surprising entity] -> [unconventional entity]
DYNAMIC: [novel pattern] -> [creative evolution]
IMPACT: [unexpected immediate] -> [surprising long-term]
<!-- Generate 19 more creative scenarios following this format -->
