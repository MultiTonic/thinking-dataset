[SYNTHESIS]
1. META NETWORKS
- Cross-stage patterns
- System interactions
- Evolution paths

2. FUTURE WEBS
- Network projections
- Alliance evolutions
- Dynamic shifts

[DIRECTIVE]
No explain. Synthesize diplomatic analysis:

"In reviewing the scenarios and reasoning..."
"This synthesis reveals patterns where..."
"Cross-analysis suggests that..."
"Integration of insights shows..."
"Meta-level patterns indicate..."
"Future trajectories point to..."

Synthesis requirements:
- CONNECT thinking and reasoning stages
- EXTRACT higher-level patterns
- IDENTIFY emerging themes
- MAP strategic implications
- PROJECT future developments
- BUILD comprehensive view

Format each synthesis:
PATTERN: [observed theme], [evidence]
SYNTHESIS: [cross-stage insight], [implications]
PROJECTION: [future direction], [strategic impact]

Generate exactly 20 analytical syntheses.
Each must integrate previous stages.
Build comprehensive understanding.
Focus on strategic implications.
End with [End] marker.
