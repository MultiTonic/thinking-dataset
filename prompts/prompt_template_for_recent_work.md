# Prompt Template for Recent Work

## Overview
This template documents the recent changes and improvements made to the project from yesterday until now. It includes refactoring, new features, added tests, and updates to documentation.

## Changes Summary

### Operations Refactoring
1. **Created New Operation Classes:**
   - `GetDownloadUrls`: Handles retrieving the download URLs for dataset files.
   - `GetFileList`: Retrieves the list of files in the dataset.

2. **Updated Tests:**
   - Created test files for `GetDownloadUrls` and `GetFileList` operations:
     - `test_get_download_urls.py`
     - `test_get_file_list.py`
   - Removed deprecated methods and updated existing test cases:
     - Removed outdated `test_dataset_file_list` from `test_dataset_downloads.py`.

3. **Refactored `DatasetDownloads` Class:**
   - Removed `get_dataset_file_list` method.
   - Updated method dependencies to use the new operation classes.

### Documentation Updates
1. **Changelog:**
   - Updated the changelog to include recent changes and refactor details:
     ```markdown
     ## [Unreleased] - 2024-12-27
     
     ### Added
     - Created `GetDownloadUrls` operation class.
     - Created tests for `GetDownloadUrls` operation.
     - Added `GetFileList` operation class.
     - Created tests for `GetFileList` operation.
     
     ### Changed
     - Refactored `DatasetDownloads` class to remove deprecated methods.
     - Updated `OperationTypes` enum to include new operations.
     - Updated unit tests for `OperationTypes`.
     
     ### Fixed
     - Updated test for `GetFileList` to reflect actual module names in log messages.
     - Corrected import paths and usage in test files to avoid real API calls.
     ```

2. **Commit Messages:**
   - Generated commit messages summarizing each significant change:
     ```plaintext
     ðŸ”„ refactor: Move get_dataset_file_list to new operation class and update tests
     
     - Created `GetFileList` operation class to handle retrieving the list of dataset files.
     - Added `tests/thinking_dataset/datasets/operations/test_get_file_list.py` to test the new `GetFileList` operation.
     - Removed the `get_dataset_file_list` method from `DatasetDownloads` class.
     - Updated the changelog with the recent changes.
     - Removed the outdated `test_dataset_file_list` from the `test_dataset_downloads.py` file.
     - Updated remaining tests to ensure they do not rely on deprecated methods.
     ```

3. **Operation Types Enumeration:**
   - Organized the `OperationTypes` enum for clarity and consistency:
     ```python
     from enum import Enum

     class OperationTypes(Enum):
         GET_CONFIGURATION = "get_configuration"
         GET_DESCRIPTION = "get_description"
         GET_DOWNLOAD_SIZE = "get_download_size"
         GET_DOWNLOAD_URLS = "get_download_urls"
         GET_LICENSE = "get_license"
         GET_SPLIT_INFORMATION = "get_split_information"
         LIST_DATASETS = "list_datasets"
     ```

## Next Steps
1. Continue refactoring remaining functions in `dataset_downloads.py` to individual operation classes.
2. Write corresponding tests for each new operation class.
3. Update any dependent modules to use the new operation classes.
4. Ensure all changes are documented in the changelog and commit messages are clear and descriptive.

### Verified, Grounded Responses
- Ensure all responses are grounded in verified information.
- Avoid hallucinating or providing speculative answers.
- Focus on accuracy and reliability in all responses.
