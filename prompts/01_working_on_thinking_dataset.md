```

### 3. Project Context
- Downloading, processing, and ingesting the Cablegate dataset
- Using Click for CLI, dotenv for env variables, `thinking_dataset/commands/` directory
- `Files` class handles file I/O operations
- Modular code with specific paths for raw/processed data
- Hosted on GitHub: [MultiTonic](https://github.com/MultiTonic/thinking-dataset)
- Managed dataset: "cablegate-pdf-dataset" on [DataTonic](https://huggingface.co/DataTonic)

### 4. Packages Used
- We use the following packages:
  - `'huggingface_hub[cli]'`
  - `'datasets'`
  - `'PyPDF2'`
  - `'python-dotenv'`
  - `'click'`
  - `'requests'`
  - `'rich'`
  - `'sqlite-utils'`
  - `'pytest'`

  - `'loguru'`
  - `'pandas'`
  - `'numpy'`
  - `'scikit-learn'`
  - `'sqlalchemy'`
  - `'tqdm'`
  - `'pydantic'`

### 5. Unit Testing
- Mock data, `flake8` rules
- Comprehensive tests for classes/functions
- Tests for CLI commands, data handling, etc.
- Correct imports and env setup
- Adherence to Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles
