This template documents the recent changes and improvements made to the project from yesterday until now. It includes refactoring, new features, added tests, and updates to documentation.

## Changes Summary

### Enhancements and Refactoring

1. **Files Worked On**:
   - `thinking_dataset/utilities/command_utils.py`
   - `thinking_dataset/pipeworks/pipes/pipe.py`
   - `thinking_dataset/pipeworks/pipelines/pipeline.py`
   - `thinking_dataset/commands/preprocess.py`
   - `thinking_dataset/commands/download.py`

2. **Updated All Source Code Header Comments**:
   - Made header comments more concise for improved readability and maintenance.

3. **Enhanced `command_utils.py`**:
   - Fixed issues with dynamic pipe class loading to correctly reflect user-defined types.
   - Improved environment variable management functions for better configuration handling.
   - Refactored paths construction to `get_raw_data_path` for clarity.

4. **Developed `pipe` and `pipeline` Modules**:
   - `pipe.py`: Defined the base `Pipe` class with input and output handling for data processing.
   - `pipeline.py`: Created the `Pipeline` class for managing and executing data processing pipelines.
   - Implemented `Pipeline.setup` to dynamically load and configure pipes based on dataset config.

5. **Expanded `preprocess.py` CLI Command**:
   - Integrated new `Pipe` and `Pipeline` classes.
   - Added logging support throughout the preprocessing workflow.
   - Enhanced environment variable loading and validation.
   - Improved data loading, processing, and saving with modular functions.
   - Created initial unit tests for the `preprocess` command to ensure proper functionality.

6. **Updated Dataset Configuration**:
   - Reorganized dataset config structure for better clarity and flexibility.
   - Added support for dynamic loading of processing pipes based on user-defined types.
   - Included display names and descriptions for better identification of processing steps.
