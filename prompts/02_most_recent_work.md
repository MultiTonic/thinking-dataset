# Prompt Template for Recent Work

## Overview
This template documents the recent changes and improvements made to the project from yesterday until now. It includes refactoring, new features, added tests, and updates to documentation.

## Changes Summary

### Operations Refactoring
1. **Created New Operation Classes:**
   - `GetDownloadUrls`: Handles retrieving the download URLs for dataset files.
   - `GetFileList`: Retrieves the list of files in the dataset.
   - `Query`: Handles executing a query on the datsabase.
   - `FetchData`: Handles fetching data from the database.

2. **Updated Tests:**
   - Created test files for `GetDownloadUrls` and `GetFileList` operations:
     - `test_get_download_urls.py`
     - `test_get_file_list.py`
   - Removed deprecated methods and updated existing test cases:
     - Removed outdated `test_dataset_file_list` from `test_dataset_downloads.py`.

3. **Refactored `DatasetDownloads` Class:**
   - Removed `get_dataset_file_list` method.
   - Updated method dependencies to use the new operation classes.

4. **Refactored Download Logic:**
   - Moved dataset download logic from `DatasetDownloads` to `commands/download.py` for better modularity and clarity.
   - Updated `commands/download.py` to handle the download process using the `download_dataset` function.

### Enhancements and New Features
1. **Implemented `load` Command:**
   - Added the `load` command to load downloaded dataset files into SQLite database.
   - Enhanced the `load` command to queue parquet files and process each one.
   - Created unit tests for the `load` command to ensure proper functionality.

2. **Enhanced `Files` Class:**
   - Updated `Files` class to include file extension filtering using `HF_DATASET_TYPE` from .env.
   - Created unit tests for the `Files` class, including extension filtering.

3. **Developed `DatabaseConfig` Class:**
   - Implemented the `DatabaseConfig` class for storing database configuration.
   - Added a validate method to ensure all configuration settings are valid.
   - Created unit tests for instantiation, validation, default values, invalid data types, and edge cases.
   - Improved test coverage for the `DatabaseConfig` class to ensure robustness and reliability.

### Fixed
1. **Resolved PytestCollectionWarning:**
   - Renamed test class in `tests/thinking_dataset/utilities/test_execute.py` to `ExampleClass` to avoid `PytestCollectionWarning`.
   - Verified that all tests pass successfully without warnings.
   - Ensured comprehensive test coverage for new and existing functionality.

2. **Updated Test Coverage and Reports:**
   - Generated and updated HTML report and coverage report.
   - Updated scripts to consistently run tests, generate reports, and measure coverage.
   - Confirmed all tests adhere to `flake8` formatting and PEP8 guidelines.
