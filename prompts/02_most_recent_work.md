# Prompt Template for Recent Work

## Overview
This template documents the recent changes and improvements made to the project from yesterday until now. It includes refactoring, new features, added tests, and updates to documentation.

## Changes Summary

### Operations Refactoring
1. **Created New Operation Classes:**
   - `GetDownloadUrls`: Handles retrieving the download URLs for dataset files.
   - `GetFileList`: Retrieves the list of files in the dataset.

2. **Updated Tests:**
   - Created test files for `GetDownloadUrls` and `GetFileList` operations:
     - `test_get_download_urls.py`
     - `test_get_file_list.py`
   - Removed deprecated methods and updated existing test cases:
     - Removed outdated `test_dataset_file_list` from `test_dataset_downloads.py`.

3. **Refactored `DatasetDownloads` Class:**
   - Removed `get_dataset_file_list` method.
   - Updated method dependencies to use the new operation classes.

4. **Refactored Download Logic:**
   - Moved dataset download logic from `DatasetDownloads` to `commands/download.py` for better modularity and clarity.
   - Updated `commands/download.py` to handle the download process using the `download_dataset` function.

### Documentation Updates
1. **Changelog:**
   - Updated the changelog to include recent changes and refactor details:

     ðŸ”„ refactor: Move get_dataset_file_list to new operation class and update tests
     
     - Created `GetFileList` operation class to handle retrieving the list of dataset files.
     - Added `tests/thinking_dataset/datasets/operations/test_get_file_list.py` to test the new `GetFileList` operation.
     - Removed the `get_dataset_file_list` method from `DatasetDownloads` class.
     - Updated the changelog with the recent changes.
     - Removed the outdated `test_dataset_file_list` from the `test_dataset_downloads.py` file.
     - Updated remaining tests to ensure they do not rely on deprecated methods.
     
     âœ¨ feat: Refactor and enhance dataset download functionality and CLI commands
     - Moved dataset download logic from `DatasetDownloads` to `commands/download.py` for better modularity and clarity.
     - Added comprehensive tests for the `download` command to ensure robust and reliable functionality.
     - Mocked environment variables, download URLs, and file creation to simulate the download process.
     - Verified output messages and download success using `pytest`.
     - Improved handling and validation of environment variables for download and clean functions.
     - Enhanced logging and progress tracking in the download process.
     - Addressed and fixed Flake8 warnings for improved code quality.
     - Verified and ensured tests pass, providing thorough coverage for the download and clean commands.
     ```

3. **Operation Types Enumeration:**
   - Organized the `OperationTypes` enum for clarity and consistency:
     ```python
     """
     @file project_root/operation_types.py
     @description Enumeration for dataset operation types.
     @version 1.0.0
     @license MIT
     @see {@link https://github.com/MultiTonic/thinking-dataset|GitHub Repository}
     @see {@link https://huggingface.co/DataTonic|Hugging Face Organization}
     """
     from enum import Enum

     class OperationTypes(Enum):
         GET_CONFIGURATION = "get_configuration"
         GET_DESCRIPTION = "get_description"
         GET_DOWNLOAD_SIZE = "get_download_size"
         GET_DOWNLOAD_URLS = "get_download_urls"
         GET_LICENSE = "get_license"
         GET_SPLIT_INFORMATION = "get_split_information"
         LIST_DATASETS = "list_datasets"
     ```

## Next Steps
1. Continue refactoring remaining functions in `dataset_downloads.py` to individual operation classes.
2. Write corresponding tests for each new operation class.
3. Update any dependent modules to use the new operation classes.
4. Ensure all changes are documented in the changelog and commit messages are clear and descriptive.

## Conclusion

### *Verified*, *Grounded* Responses
- Ensure all responses are grounded in verified information.
- Avoid hallucinating or providing speculative answers.
- Focus on accuracy and reliability in all responses.

### Important
1. **Do not *mimic* or *echo* what you read**
2. **Reread your response before sending and correct any mistakes.**
3. **Return concise and complete responses**
4. **Only provide explaination when *asked***
5. **When ask to code, always return *1* file at a time**
6. **When loosing context, ask user for this template**

### All Clear Protocol
- Use the phrase `5 by 5` to signify that all pytests, user tests, changes commit, no errors, ready for launch, all clear for next instructions.

**Your response to this query will only be: `Ready To Code!** ðŸš€`**
