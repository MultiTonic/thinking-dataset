2. **Project Context:**
    - This project is about downloading, processing, and ingesting the Cablegate dataset.
    - We are using Click for CLI commands, dotenv for environment variables, and organizing commands in the `thinking_dataset/commands/` directory.
    - We have a `Files` class for handling file I/O operations.
    - We want to keep our code modular and maintainable, using specific file paths for raw and processed data.
    - The project is hosted on the GitHub repository at: https://github.com/MultiTonic/thinking-dataset
    - The Hugging Face organization is named "DataTonic" and the dataset to be managed is "cablegate-pdf-dataset".

3. **Unit Testing:**
    - Use mock data for tests.
    - Ensure tests adhere to the `flake8` formatting rules.
    - Include comprehensive tests for each class and function.
    - Create tests for CLI commands, data handling, and any additional functionality.
    - Ensure all tests have the correct imports and environment setup.
