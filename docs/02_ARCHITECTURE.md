# Architecture

## Overview

The "Dark Thoughts" thinking-dataset project develops and analyzes complex psychological scenarios, ethical dilemmas, and decision-making processes. The architecture includes key components like data ingestion, preprocessing, enrichment, model training, and evaluation. The system leverages various serverless endpoints and adapters to ensure flexibility and scalability.

## Key Components

The project relies on several core elements: Data Ingestion for collecting raw data; Data Preprocessing for cleaning, transforming, and validating data; Data Enrichment and Case Study Creation for generating scenarios and case studies; Model Training and Evaluation for training and assessing AI models; Inference Endpoint Adapters for integrating various serverless endpoints; and Continuous Improvement for refining the dataset and models based on feedback. Each component plays a vital role in analyzing complex psychological scenarios, ethical dilemmas, and decision-making processes.

### 1. Data Ingestion

Data ingestion collects raw data from multiple sources, including historical records, literature, user-generated content, and the WikiLeaks Cablegate dataset. This raw data is stored in a structured format using SQLite, ensuring it is readily accessible for further processing.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves several steps to prepare the raw data for analysis. Data cleaning removes duplicates, handles missing values, and normalizes the data. Data transformation converts the raw data into a standardized format suitable for analysis. Data validation ensures the integrity and quality of the data before it moves to the next phase.

### 3. Data Enrichment and Case Study Creation

In the data enrichment and case study creation phase, seed objects are generated using predefined keywords and cables. These seed objects are combined to create detailed scenarios called cables. The cables are then used to generate detailed case studies with injected data points. Finally, the case studies are refined into a consistent format suitable for model training.

### 4. Model Training and Evaluation

Model training and evaluation begin with dataset preparation, which involves validating data integrity, balancing classes, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. Models are trained using this prepared dataset, including both baseline and fine-tuned models. The evaluation system scores the models and compares the performance of fine-tuned models against baseline models.

### 5. Inference Endpoint Adapters/Bridges

The project employs a unified interface to ensure consistency across different inference adapters. Adapter implementations are developed for various serverless endpoints, such as Hugging Face, Ollama, testcontainers, and Runpod. These adapters are seamlessly integrated into the main application to leverage the best tools for different tasks.

### 6. Continuous Improvement

Continuous improvement involves gathering user and system feedback to iteratively refine and update the dataset and models. Comprehensive documentation of methods, changes, and updates is maintained to ensure transparency and reproducibility. The project also engages with the community for contributions and collaboration, fostering an environment of continuous enhancement and innovation.

## Technology Stack

The "Dark Thoughts" thinking-dataset project uses technologies chosen for their efficiency, scalability, and integration ease. Python serves as the core language for its extensive libraries and community support. SQLite is lightweight and fast for structured data. Libraries like pandas and scikit-learn offer robust data manipulation and machine learning capabilities, while rich improves console output and error handling. Tools like python-dotenv and SQLAlchemy manage configuration and database interactions. Serverless computing platforms and state machine management enhance flexibility and scalability.
