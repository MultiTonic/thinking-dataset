Excellent point! Let's incorporate that information into the architecture document.

# Architecture

## Overview

The "Dark Thoughts" thinking-dataset project develops and analyzes complex strategic scenarios, ethical dilemmas, and decision-making processes. The architecture includes key components such as data ingestion, preprocessing, enrichment, model training, evaluation, and continuous improvement. The system leverages various serverless endpoints and adapters to ensure flexibility and scalability.

## Key Components

The project relies on several core elements: Data Ingestion for collecting raw data; Data Preprocessing for cleaning, transforming, and validating data; Data Enrichment and Case Study Creation for generating scenarios and case studies; Model Training and Evaluation for training and assessing AI models; Inference Endpoint Adapters for integrating various serverless endpoints; and Continuous Improvement for refining the dataset and models based on feedback. Each component plays a vital role in analyzing complex strategic scenarios, ethical dilemmas, and decision-making processes.

### 1. Data Ingestion

Data ingestion involves collecting raw data from multiple sources, including historical records, literature, user-generated content, and the WikiLeaks Cablegate dataset. This raw data is stored in a structured format using SQLite, ensuring it is readily accessible for further processing.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves several steps to prepare the raw data for analysis:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removes duplicates, handles missing values, and normalizes the data.
- **Data Transformation**: Converts raw data into a standardized format suitable for analysis.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures the integrity and quality of the data before it moves to the next phase.

### 3. Data Enrichment and Case Study Creation

In the data enrichment and case study creation phase:
- **Seed Generation**: Seed objects are generated using predefined keywords and knowledge from source cables.
- **Cable Creation**: Seed objects are combined to create detailed scenarios called cables.
- **Persona Database**: Stakeholder personas are generated and stored using the personas dataset on Hugging Face.
- **Synthetic SitRep Generation**: Synthetic Situation Reports (SitReps) are generated inspired by random seed objects.
- **Case Study Generation**: SitReps are distributed to various imaginary stakeholders, who then write detailed case studies maximizing their stake or claim. Case studies are enriched with a chain of thoughts for use in Self-Teaching with Reinforcement (STaR).

### 4. Model Training and Evaluation

Model training and evaluation begin with:
- **Dataset Preparation**: Validating data integrity, balancing classes, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Training baseline models using the prepared dataset, followed by fine-tuning models for improved performance. Our model is built on the foundation of the Yi model.
- **Evaluation System Development**: Implementing an evaluation system to score models and compare the performance of fine-tuned models against baseline models. We are developing the STaR (Self-Teaching with Reinforcement) system to augment the capabilities of our thinking model to be on par with the capabilities of GPT-4.

### 5. Inference Endpoint Adapters/Bridges

The project employs a unified interface to ensure consistency across different inference adapters:
- **Adapter Implementations**: Developing concrete implementations for various endpoints (e.g., Hugging Face, Ollama, testcontainers, Runpod).
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrating adapters into the main application to leverage the best tools for different tasks.

### 6. Continuous Improvement

Continuous improvement involves:
- **Feedback Loop**: Gathering user and system feedback to iteratively refine and update the dataset and models.
- **Documentation**: Maintaining comprehensive documentation of methods, changes, and updates to ensure transparency and reproducibility.
- **Community Engagement**: Engaging with the community for contributions and collaboration, fostering an environment of continuous enhancement and innovation.

## Technology Stack

The "Dark Thoughts" thinking-dataset project uses technologies chosen for their efficiency, scalability, and ease of integration. Python serves as the core language for its extensive libraries and community support. SQLite is lightweight and fast for structured data. Libraries like pandas and scikit-learn offer robust data manipulation and machine learning capabilities, while rich improves console output and error handling. Tools like python-dotenv and SQLAlchemy manage configuration and database interactions. Serverless computing platforms and state machine management enhance flexibility and scalability.

It illustrates the flow and interaction between the project's key components, ensuring a robust, scalable, and efficient system. Each component plays a vital role in the seamless operation of the project, from data ingestion to continuous improvement.

The diagram starts with **Data Ingestion**, where raw data from multiple sources, including historical records, literature, and user-generated content, is collected and stored in a structured format using SQLite. **Data Preprocessing** follows, involving data cleaning to remove duplicates and handle missing values, data transformation to standardize the format, and data validation to ensure integrity.

Next, the **Data Enrichment** phase generates seed objects using predefined keywords and cables, combines them to create detailed scenarios (cables), and generates case studies refined into a consistent format for model training. **Model Training** involves preparing datasets, training both baseline and fine-tuned models, and evaluating their performance.

**Inference Endpoint Adapters** and bridges integrate various serverless endpoints like Hugging Face, Ollama, testcontainers, and Runpod through a unified interface, ensuring consistency and seamless operation. The **Continuous Improvement** phase gathers user and system feedback to iteratively refine the dataset and models, maintaining comprehensive documentation and fostering community engagement.

At the core lies the **Foundation**, comprising core technologies and infrastructure that support all components. The feedback loop ensures continuous data ingestion and improvement by feeding insights back into the system, creating a cycle of synthetic SitReps and case study generation.
