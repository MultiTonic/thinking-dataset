# Architecture

## Overview

The Thinking Dataset Project is designed to develop and analyze complex strategic scenarios, ethical dilemmas, and decision-making processes. The architecture includes key components such as data ingestion, preprocessing, enrichment, model training, evaluation, and continuous improvement. The system leverages various serverless endpoints and adapters to ensure flexibility and scalability.

## Key Components

The project relies on several core elements: Data Ingestion for collecting raw data; Data Preprocessing for cleaning, transforming, and validating data; Data Enrichment and Case Study Creation for generating scenarios and case studies; Model Training and Evaluation for training and assessing AI models; Inference Endpoint Adapters for integrating various serverless endpoints; and Continuous Improvement for refining the dataset and models based on feedback. Each component plays a vital role in analyzing complex strategic scenarios, ethical dilemmas, and decision-making processes.

### 1. Data Ingestion

Data ingestion involves collecting raw data from multiple sources, including historical records, literature, user-generated content, and the WikiLeaks Cablegate dataset. This raw data is stored in a structured format using SQLite, ensuring it is readily accessible for further processing.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves several steps to prepare the raw data for analysis:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and normalizing the data.
- **Data Transformation**: Converting raw data into a standardized format suitable for analysis.
- **Data Validation**: Ensuring the integrity and quality of the data before it moves to the next phase.

### 3. Data Enrichment and Case Study Creation

In the data enrichment and case study creation phase:
- **Seed Generation**: Seed objects are generated using predefined keywords and knowledge from source cables.
- **Cable Creation**: Seed objects are combined to create detailed scenarios called cables.
- **Persona Database**: Stakeholder personas are generated and stored using the personas dataset on Hugging Face.
- **Synthetic SitRep Generation**: Synthetic Situation Reports (SitReps) are generated inspired by random seed objects.
- **Case Study Generation**: SitReps are distributed to various imaginary stakeholders, who then write detailed case studies maximizing their stake or claim. Case studies are enriched with a chain of thoughts for use in Self-Teaching with Reinforcement (STaR).

### 4. Model Training and Evaluation

Model training and evaluation begin with:
- **Dataset Preparation**: Validating data integrity, balancing classes, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Training baseline models using the prepared dataset, followed by fine-tuning models for improved performance. Our model is built on the foundation of the Yi model.
- **Evaluation System Development**: Implementing an evaluation system to score models and compare the performance of fine-tuned models against baseline models. We are developing the STaR (Self-Teaching with Reinforcement) system to augment the capabilities of our thinking model to be on par with the capabilities of GPT-4.

### 5. Inference Endpoint Adapters

Inference Endpoint Adapters provide flexibility and scalability by integrating with various serverless endpoints:
- **Hugging Face**: For accessing pretrained NLP models and custom endpoints.
- **Ollama**: For leveraging proprietary models and services.
- **Testcontainers**: For local testing and development in isolated environments.
- **Runpod**: For scalable, serverless computing resources.

### 6. Continuous Improvement

Continuous improvement involves iteratively refining the datasets and models based on user and system feedback:
- **Feedback Loop**: Gathering user and system feedback to iteratively refine and update the dataset and models.
- **Regular Updates**: Regularly updating the project with new data sources, model improvements, and enhanced algorithms to keep it current and relevant.
- **Documentation**: Maintaining comprehensive documentation of methods, changes, and updates to ensure transparency and reproducibility.
- **Community Engagement**: Engaging with the community for contributions and collaboration, fostering an environment of continuous enhancement and innovation.

## Technology Stack

The Thinking Dataset Project uses technologies chosen for their efficiency, scalability, and ease of integration. Python serves as the core language due to its extensive libraries and community support. SQLite is lightweight and fast for structured data. Libraries like pandas and scikit-learn offer robust data manipulation and machine learning capabilities, while rich enhances console output and error handling. Tools like python-dotenv and SQLAlchemy manage configuration and database interactions. Serverless computing platforms and state machine management enhance flexibility and scalability.
