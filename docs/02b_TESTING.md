# Testing

## Overview

The primary objective of this test plan is to ensure that the processes for downloading, processing, and ingesting the Hugging Face dataset into SQLite3 are robust, reliable, and meet the specified requirements. By implementing Test-Driven Development (TDD), we aim to create a comprehensive suite of granular tests that cover all critical functionalities of the data pipeline. The tests will be organized into three levels of directories to enhance structure and maintainability.

## Objectives

- **Validate dataset download**: Ensure the dataset can be successfully downloaded from Hugging Face.
- **Verify PDF text extraction**: Confirm text can be accurately extracted from PDF files.
- **Test dataset processing**: Ensure the dataset is correctly processed into a DataFrame.
- **Validate data ingestion**: Confirm the processed data is correctly inserted into the SQLite3 database.
- **Ensure data cleaning accuracy**: Validate operations such as removing duplicates and handling missing values.
- **Confirm data transformation**: Validate operations such as merging datasets, enriching data, and deriving new features.
- **Verify data validation**: Ensure schema validation and data integrity checks.
- **Quality assurance**: Verify the final dataset meets quality standards and performance metrics, incorporating user feedback.

## Directory Structure

The tests are organized into the following directory structure:

## Running Tests

To run the tests, navigate to the root of your project directory and use the following command:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

This command will run all the tests in the specified directory, ensuring that each component of the data pipeline functions as expected.

## Conclusion

By implementing granular and focused tests organized in a clear directory structure, we ensure that our data pipeline is thoroughly validated at each stage. This approach helps maintain code quality, prevent bugs, and facilitate future enhancements.
