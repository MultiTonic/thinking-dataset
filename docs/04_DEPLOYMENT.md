# Deployment

## Overview

This document provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the "Dark Thoughts" thinking-dataset project. Follow these steps to ensure a smooth deployment process, including setting up the server environment, initializing the application, and configuring nodes for distributed processing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Server/Hosting Environment**: A server or hosting environment with Python 3.7 or higher installed.
- **Database**: SQLite or any other compatible database.
- **Environment Variables**: Necessary environment variables configured for the deployment environment.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Set Up the Server Environment

1. **Access the Server**: Connect to your server via SSH or any other method provided by your hosting service.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your server:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MultiTonic/thinking-dataset.git
   cd thinking-dataset
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**: Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

### 2. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the project and its dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and configure the necessary environment variables. You can use the provided `.env.example` file as a template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit the `.env` file to include your specific configuration settings:
```plaintext
HF_HOME="~/.cache/huggingface"
HF_TOKEN="my_huggingface_access_token"
HF_PROJECT="thinking-dataset"
HF_DATASET="cablegate-pdf-dataset"
HF_ORGANIZATION="DataTonic"
HF_USER="my_huggingface_username"
```

### 4. Initialize the Database

Run the following command to initialize the database:
```bash
thinking-dataset load
```

### 5. Configure the Application

Ensure the application is configured correctly by updating any necessary settings in the configuration files. This includes:

- **Database Configuration**: Ensure the database settings in the `.env` file are correct.
- **Server Configuration**: Update any server-specific settings such as host, port, and other configurations.

### 6. Run the Application

Start the application using the following command:
```bash
thinking-dataset serve
```
Ensure the application is running correctly and accessible from the desired endpoint.

### 7. Setting Up Nodes for Distributed Processing

To set up nodes that will handle inference or other distributed processing tasks, use the following command:
```bash
thinking-dataset node
```
Nodes will be automatically provisioned based on their capabilities. The server instance acts as the root in the swarm, managing the nodes. If multiple server instances are present in the same swarm cluster, they will mirror each other for replication and redundancy.

### 8. Set Up Process Manager (Optional)

For production environments, it is recommended to use a process manager such as `pm2` or `supervisord` to ensure the application runs continuously and restarts automatically if it crashes.

#### Using `pm2`
1. **Install pm2**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   ```

2. **Start the Application with pm2**:
   ```bash
   pm2 start thinking-dataset serve
   ```

3. **Save the pm2 Process List**:
   ```bash
   pm2 save
   ```

4. **Set up pm2 Startup Script**:
   ```bash
   pm2 startup
   ```

### 9. Monitoring and Logging

Implement monitoring and logging to keep track of the applicationâ€™s performance and diagnose any issues. Tools such as `Loguru` (for logging) and various monitoring services can be used.

### 10. Regular Maintenance

Regularly update the project dependencies and environment to ensure the application remains secure and up-to-date:

- **Update Dependencies**:
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
  ```

- **Pull Latest Changes**:
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```

### 11. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment, refer to the [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) file for common issues and their solutions.
