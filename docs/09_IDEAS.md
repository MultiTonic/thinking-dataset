# Ideas

## Overview
The "Dark Thoughts" project aims to explore and understand complex psychological scenarios, including ethical dilemmas, cognitive biases, and the decision-making processes of individuals under various circumstances. This document outlines potential ideas and directions for the project.

## Project Goals
- Develop a comprehensive dataset of hypothetical scenarios involving moral and ethical challenges.
- Create synthetic case studies to train AI models in reasoning, ethics, and decision-making.
- Analyze and simulate human cognitive processes to gain insights into how decisions are made under pressure.

## Ideas and Concepts

### 1. Scenario Development
#### Description
- Create detailed hypothetical scenarios that present ethical dilemmas or cognitive biases.
- Ensure scenarios are varied and cover a wide range of topics, including personal, social, and professional situations.

#### Examples
- **Moral Dilemma**: A doctor must choose between saving one patient over another due to limited resources.

### 2. Persona Creation
#### Description
- Develop detailed personas with backgrounds, motivations, and psychological profiles.
- Personas should represent a diverse range of demographics and viewpoints.

#### Examples
- **Persona 1**: Alice, a 35-year-old emergency room doctor facing a critical decision during a mass casualty incident.
- **Persona 2**: Bob, a 28-year-old data analyst grappling with ethical concerns in a corporate setting.

### 3. Data Collection and Annotation
#### Description
- Collect raw data from various sources, including historical records, literature, and user-generated content.

#### Example Implementation
- Define an abstract class for adapters:
  ```python
  from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

  class InferenceEndpointAdapter(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      def initialize(self):
          pass

      @abstractmethod
      def predict(self, input_data):
          pass

      @abstractmethod
      def cleanup(self):
          pass
  ```

- Implement a concrete adapter for Hugging Face API:
  ```python
  from transformers import pipeline
  from dotenv import load_dotenv
  import os

  class HuggingFaceAdapter(InferenceEndpointAdapter):
      def __init__(self):
          load_dotenv()
          self.model = None

      def initialize(self):
          self.model = pipeline("text-generation", model=os.getenv("HUGGINGFACE_MODEL"))

      def predict(self, input_data):
          return self.model(input_data)[0]["generated_text"]

      def cleanup(self):
          pass  # Any cleanup tasks if necessary
  ```

- Integrate adapters into the main application:
  ```python
  class InferenceManager:
      def __init__(self):
          self.adapters = []

      def register_adapter(self, adapter):
          self.adapters.append(adapter)
          adapter.initialize()

      def predict_all(self, input_data):
          results = {}
          for adapter in self.adapters:
              results[adapter.__class__.__name__] = adapter.predict(input_data)
          return results

      def cleanup(self):
          for adapter in self.adapters:
              adapter.cleanup()

  # Example usage
  manager = InferenceManager()
  manager.register_adapter(HuggingFaceAdapter())
  # Add other adapters as needed

  input_data = "Once upon a time..."
  results = manager.predict_all(input_data)
  print(results)
  manager.cleanup()
  ```
