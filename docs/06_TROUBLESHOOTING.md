## Virtual Environment Issues

### Virtual Environment Activation

**Problem:** Unable to activate the virtual environment.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you are in the correct directory where the virtual environment was created.
2. Use the correct command for your operating system:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
3. If the above commands don't work, ensure you have permission to execute the script and that your terminal/command prompt has the necessary access rights.

### Dependency Installation

**Problem:** Dependencies are not installing correctly.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated before running the installation command:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
2. Check the `setup.py` file for any missing or incorrect dependencies and ensure the file is correctly formatted.

## Database Issues

### SQLite Database Initialization

**Problem:** SQLite database is not initializing correctly.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you have the SQLite library included in your Python installation.
2. Run the initialization command while the virtual environment is activated:
   ```bash
   thinking-dataset load
   ```
3. Check for any errors or missing commands in the initialization script and ensure the database file is created in the correct directory.

## Running the Application

### Command Not Found

**Problem:** The `thinking-dataset` command is not recognized.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated.
2. Confirm that the package is installed in editable mode using the correct command:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
3. Check the `setup.py` file for the correct entry points and ensure the installation process completed without errors.

## Common Errors

### ModuleNotFoundError

**Problem:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'module_name'`.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure the module is listed in the `install_requires` section of `setup.py`.
2. Reinstall the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

### ImportError

**Problem:** `ImportError: cannot import name 'name' from 'module'`.

**Solution:**
1. Verify the module and the name being imported are correct.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly and are compatible with each other.

### SyntaxError

**Problem:** `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`.

**Solution:**
1. Check the syntax of your code and ensure it follows the correct Python version you are using.
2. Ensure you are running the code with the correct Python interpreter by verifying the virtual environment is active.

## Performance Issues

### Slow Data Processing

**Problem:** Data processing is taking longer than expected.

**Solution:**
1. Optimize data processing scripts by using efficient data structures and algorithms.
2. Use `pandas` for data manipulation and take advantage of its vectorized operations.
3. Profile your code to identify bottlenecks and optimize them.

### High Memory Usage

**Problem:** The application is using too much memory.

**Solution:**
1. Optimize memory usage by processing data in chunks or batches.
2. Use memory-efficient data structures and techniques in your code.
3. Monitor memory usage and profile your code to identify and fix memory leaks.
