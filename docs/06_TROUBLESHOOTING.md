## Virtual Environment Issues

### Virtual Environment Activation

**Problem:** Unable to activate the virtual environment.

**Solution:**
- Ensure you are in the correct directory where the virtual environment was created.
- Use the correct command for your operating system:
  - **Windows**:
    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - **macOS/Linux**:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
- If the above commands don't work, ensure you have permission to execute the script and that your terminal/command prompt has the necessary access rights.

### Dependency Installation

**Problem:** Dependencies are not installing correctly.

**Solution:**
- Ensure the virtual environment is activated before running the installation command:
  ```bash
  pip install -e .
  ```
- Check the `setup.py` file for any missing or incorrect dependencies and make sure the file is correctly formatted.

## Database Issues

### SQLite Database Initialization

**Problem:** SQLite database is not initializing correctly.

**Solution:**
- Ensure you have the SQLite library included in your Python installation.
- Run the initialization script while the virtual environment is activated:
  ```bash
  python scripts/init_db.py
  ```
- Check the script for any errors or missing commands and ensure that the database file is created in the correct directory.

## Running the Application

### Command Not Found

**Problem:** The `thinking-dataset` command is not recognized.

**Solution:**
- Ensure the virtual environment is activated.
- Confirm that the package is installed in editable mode using the correct command:
  ```bash
  pip install -e .
  ```
- Check the `setup.py` file for the correct entry points and make sure the installation process completed without errors.

## Common Errors

### ModuleNotFoundError

**Problem:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'module_name'`.

**Solution:**
- Ensure the module is listed in the `install_requires` section of `setup.py`.
- Reinstall the dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -e .
  ```

### ImportError

**Problem:** `ImportError: cannot import name 'name' from 'module'`.

**Solution:**
- Verify the module and the name being imported are correct.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly and are compatible with each other.

### SyntaxError

**Problem:** `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`.

**Solution:**
- Check the syntax of your code and ensure it follows the correct Python version you are using.
- Ensure you are running the code with the correct Python interpreter by verifying the virtual environment is active.

## Performance Issues

### Slow Data Processing

**Problem:** Data processing is taking longer than expected.

**Solution:**
- Optimize data processing scripts by using efficient data structures and algorithms.
- Use `pandas` for data manipulation and take advantage of its vectorized operations.
- Profile your code to identify bottlenecks and optimize them.

### High Memory Usage

**Problem:** The application is using too much memory.

**Solution:**
- Optimize memory usage by processing data in chunks or batches.
- Use memory-efficient data structures and techniques in your code.
- Monitor memory usage and profile your code to identify and fix memory leaks.
