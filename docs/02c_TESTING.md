# Testing

## Overview

The primary objective of this test plan is to ensure that the processes for downloading, processing, and ingesting the Hugging Face dataset into SQLite3 are robust, reliable, and meet the specified requirements. By implementing Test-Driven Development (TDD), we aim to create a comprehensive suite of granular tests that cover all critical functionalities of the data pipeline. The tests will be organized into structured directories to enhance maintainability.

## Objectives

- **Validate dataset download**: Ensure the dataset can be successfully downloaded from Hugging Face.
- **Verify PDF text extraction**: Confirm text can be accurately extracted from PDF files.
- **Test dataset processing**: Ensure the dataset is correctly processed into a DataFrame.
- **Validate data ingestion**: Confirm the processed data is correctly inserted into the SQLite3 database.
- **Ensure data cleaning accuracy**: Validate operations such as removing duplicates and handling missing values.
- **Confirm data transformation**: Validate operations such as merging datasets, enriching data, and deriving new features.
- **Verify data validation**: Ensure schema validation and data integrity checks.
- **Quality assurance**: Verify the final dataset meets quality standards and performance metrics, incorporating user feedback.

## Directory Structure

The tests are organized into the following directory structure:

```
tests/
├── dataset/              # Tests related to dataset operations
│   ├── test_download.py  # Tests focused on downloading the dataset
│   ├── test_extract.py   # Tests focused on extracting text from PDFs
│   ├── test_process.py   # Tests focused on processing the dataset
│   └── test_ingest.py    # Tests focused on ingesting the dataset into SQLite3
├── clean/                # Tests related to data cleaning
│   ├── test_remove_duplicates.py  # Tests focused on removing duplicates
│   ├── test_handle_missing.py     # Tests focused on handling missing values
├── transform/            # Tests related to data transformation

└── qa/                   # Quality assurance tests
    ├── test_quality_standards.py   # Tests focused on meeting quality standards
    ├── test_performance_metrics.py # Tests focused on performance metrics
```

## Test Cases

### 1. Dataset Download

**Objective:** Verify successful download and integrity of the dataset from Hugging Face.

### 2. PDF Text Extraction

**Objective:** Ensure text can be accurately extracted from PDF files.

### 3. Dataset Processing

**Objective:** Confirm the dataset is processed correctly into a DataFrame.

### 4. Data Ingestion into SQLite3

**Objective:** Validate that processed data is correctly inserted into the SQLite3 database.

### 5. Data Cleaning

**Objective:** Ensure data cleaning operations such as removing duplicates and handling missing values are accurate.

### 6. Data Transformation

**Objective:** Confirm that data transformation operations such as merging datasets, enriching data, and deriving new features are performed correctly.

### 7. Data Validation

**Objective:** Validate the schema and integrity of the data, ensuring consistency across subsets.

### 8. Quality Assurance

**Objective:** Verify the final dataset meets quality standards and performance metrics, incorporating user feedback.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, navigate to the root of your project directory and use the following command:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

This command will run all the tests in the specified directory, ensuring that each component of the data pipeline functions as expected.

## Conclusion

By implementing granular and focused tests organized in a clear directory structure, we ensure that our data pipeline is thoroughly validated at each stage. This approach helps maintain code quality, prevent bugs, and facilitate future enhancements.
