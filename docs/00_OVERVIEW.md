### Directive

The primary goal of the "Dark Thoughts" thinking-dataset project is to generate accurate and complex chains of thought reasoning for real-world Situational Reports (SitReps) and create useful and meaningful case study reports based on a set of socio-economic conditions and stakeholders. By achieving this, the project seeks to provide valuable insights into decision-making processes and enhance the capabilities of AI models in handling complicated scenarios.

### Objectives

The key objectives of the "Dark Thoughts" thinking-dataset project are to:

- **Create Diverse Scenarios**: Develop a wide range of hypothetical scenarios that encompass various ethical dilemmas and cognitive biases.
- **Analyze Human Cognition**: Use the dataset to analyze and simulate human cognitive processes, improving our understanding of decision-making and ethics.
- **Train AI Models**: Train AI models in reasoning, ethics, and decision-making using the generated dataset, enhancing their ability to handle complex situations.
- **Promote AI Ethics**: Contribute to the field of AI ethics by providing a dataset that highlights ethical considerations in AI development.

### Key Features

- **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**: Efficient methods for collecting and preprocessing raw data from various sources, ensuring data quality and consistency.
- **Scenario Generation**: Innovative techniques for generating detailed hypothetical scenarios using seed objects and cables.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Comprehensive processes for training and evaluating AI models, including baseline and fine-tuned models.
- **Inference Adapters**: Flexible adapters for integrating with various inference endpoints, such as Hugging Face, Ollama, testcontainers, and Runpod.
