## Abstract

The Thinking Dataset Project is designed to build a comprehensive dataset focused on real-world Situational Reports (SitReps) to facilitate strategic business insights and the generation of STaR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) case studies. This project aims to utilize cutting-edge technologies and frameworks to manage, process, and analyze a wide range of data efficiently, providing valuable insights for business leaders and decision-makers.

## Objectives

The primary goal of the Thinking Dataset Project is to generate accurate and complex chains of thought reasoning for real-world SitReps and create meaningful case study reports based on socio-economic conditions and stakeholders. Key objectives include:

- **Create Diverse Scenarios**: Develop a wide range of hypothetical scenarios encompassing various strategic dilemmas and cognitive biases.
- **Analyze Human Cognition**: Use the dataset to analyze and simulate human cognitive processes, improving our understanding of decision-making, strategy, and ethics.
- **Train AI Models**: Train AI models in reasoning, strategy, and ethical decision-making using the dataset, enhancing their ability to handle complex situations.
- **Promote Strategic AI**: Contribute to AI strategy by providing a dataset that highlights strategic and ethical considerations in AI development, attracting business leaders and government officials.

## Key Features

The project enhances dataset quality through efficient data ingestion, preprocessing, and scenario generation using innovative techniques. Comprehensive AI model training and evaluation processes incorporate both baseline and fine-tuned models. Flexible inference adapters integrate with various endpoints like Hugging Face, Ollama, testcontainers, and Runpod. Continuous refinement is supported by an iterative feedback loop, leveraging the WikiLeaks Cablegate dataset for rich socio-economic scenarios.

## Structure

The project is organized into key components covering each phase of the pipeline:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Collecting raw data from diverse sources, including historical records, literature, and user-generated content.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning data to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and normalize it for consistency.
3. **Data Enrichment and Case Study Creation**: Generating detailed case studies by combining seed objects into cables and refining them into a standard format.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Preparing datasets for training, training AI models, and evaluating their performance against strategic and ethical benchmarks.
5. **Inference Endpoint Adapters/Bridges**: Developing and integrating adapters to support various serverless endpoints.
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Iteratively refining datasets and models based on user and system feedback, keeping the project current and relevant.
