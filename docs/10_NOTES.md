### Development Notes

#### General Overview
- **Project Name**: Dark Thoughts
- **Purpose**: Create a dataset of hypothetical scenarios involving ethical dilemmas and cognitive biases to train AI models in reasoning, ethics, and decision-making.

### Project Phases

#### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration
- **Project Initialization**: Set up the `ThinkingDatasetProject` directory.
- **Dependencies Installed**: Installed necessary Python packages and Semantic Kernel.
- **README**: Created README.md to outline project goals, objectives, and setup instructions.

#### Phase 2: Data Pipeline Development
- **Raw Data Ingestion**: Collected and stored initial raw data sources.
- **Data Cleaning**: Implemented methods to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and normalize data.
- **Seed Generation**: Defined and generated seed objects using predefined keywords.

#### Phase 3: Data Enrichment and Case Study Creation
- **Cable Creation**: Combined seed objects to generate cables.
- **Case Study Generation**: Used cables to create detailed case studies.
- **Standard Format Distillation**: Refined case studies into a standard dataset format (e.g., `input_text`, `features`, `context`, `target`).

#### Phase 4: Model Training and Evaluation
- **Final Dataset Preparation**: Validated data integrity, balanced classes, and split data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Trained baseline and fine-tuned models using the dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Scored models and compared fine-tuned models against baseline models.

#### Phase 5: Continuous Improvement
- **Feedback Loop**: Gathered feedback to iteratively refine and update the dataset and models.
- **Documentation**: Maintained comprehensive documentation of methods and updates.
- **Community Engagement**: Engaged with the community for contributions and collaboration.

### Ideas and Features
- **Scenario Development**: Create hypothetical scenarios with ethical dilemmas or cognitive biases.
- **Persona Creation**: Develop detailed personas with backgrounds, motivations, and profiles.
- **Data Collection and Annotation**: Collect raw data, annotate key themes, ethical issues, and decision points.
- **Cognitive Bias Analysis**: Analyze scenarios for cognitive biases and their impact on decision-making.
- **Ethical Decision-Making Framework**: Develop a framework for evaluating ethical decisions.
- **AI Model Training and Evaluation**: Train AI models on synthetic case studies and evaluate their performance.
- **User Interaction and Feedback**: Create interactive tools for user engagement and feedback.

### Inference Endpoint Adapters/Bridges
#### Description
- Develop adapters to integrate serverless endpoints into the application.
- Support endpoints like LLama.cpp, testcontainers, Runpod, and Hugging Face API.

#### Design Considerations
- **Unified Interface**: Create a common interface for consistency.
- **Configuration Management**: Securely manage different endpoints and credentials.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement robust logging and monitoring.
- **Error Handling**: Manage failures gracefully with comprehensive error handling.
- **Performance Optimization**: Evaluate latency and throughput of each endpoint.
- **Security**: Ensure strong security measures for data protection.

### Next Steps
- Develop unit tests for basic LLama.cpp functionality.
- Verify chat completion and text generation using LLama.cpp.
- Configure Serilog for enhanced logging.
- Set up configuration management with `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`.
- Integrate MediatR for a robust event system.
- Document and refine the case study generation pipeline.
- Implement and test various inference endpoint adapters/bridges.
- Experiment with Testcontainers for deploying and managing Docker containers.
- Set up local serverless endpoints to work as nodes in a swarm.
- Configure dynamic workflows for nodes using simple YAML files.
- Explore additional features like ethical decision-making simulations and scenario customization.
- Collaborate with educational institutions and research organizations.
- Continuously gather feedback to improve the project.
