### Development Notes

#### General Overview
- **Project Name**: Dark Thoughts
- **Purpose**: Develop a comprehensive dataset of hypothetical scenarios involving ethical dilemmas and cognitive biases to train AI models in reasoning, ethics, and decision-making.

### Project Phases

#### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration
- **Project Initialization**: Created and configured the `ThinkingDatasetProject` directory.
- **Dependencies Installed**: Installed Semantic Kernel and various Python packages for development and data handling.
- **README**: Created and finalized the README.md to outline project goals, objectives, and setup instructions.

#### Phase 2: Data Pipeline Development
- **Raw Data Ingestion**: Collected initial raw data sources and set up mechanisms for raw data storage.
- **Data Cleaning**: Implemented methods to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and normalize data.
- **Seed Generation**: Defined and generated seed objects using predefined keywords.

#### Phase 3: Data Enrichment and Case Study Creation
- **Cable Creation**: Combined multiple seed objects to generate cables.
- **Case Study Generation**: Used cables to generate detailed case studies with injected data points.
- **Standard Format Distillation**: Refined case studies into a standard dataset format (e.g., `input_text`, `features`, `context`, `target`, etc.).

#### Phase 4: Model Training and Evaluation
- **Final Dataset Preparation**: Validated data integrity, balanced classes, and split data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Trained baseline and fine-tuned models using the prepared dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Implemented an evaluation system to score models and compare fine-tuned models against baseline models.

#### Phase 5: Continuous Improvement
- **Feedback Loop**: Gathered user and system feedback, iteratively refined and updated the dataset and models.
- **Documentation**: Maintained comprehensive documentation of methods, changes, and updates.
- **Community Engagement**: Engaged with the community for contributions and collaboration, opened issues and pull requests for enhancements.

### Ideas and Features
- **Scenario Development**: Create hypothetical scenarios presenting ethical dilemmas or cognitive biases.
- **Persona Creation**: Develop detailed personas with backgrounds, motivations, and psychological profiles.
- **Data Collection and Annotation**: Collect raw data from various sources, annotate key themes, ethical issues, and decision points.
- **Cognitive Bias Analysis**: Analyze scenarios for common cognitive biases and their impact on decision-making.
- **Ethical Decision-Making Framework**: Develop a framework for evaluating ethical decisions within scenarios.
- **AI Model Training and Evaluation**: Train AI models on synthetic case studies, evaluate their performance against ethical benchmarks.
- **User Interaction and Feedback**: Create interactive tools for user engagement and collect feedback.

### Inference Endpoint Adapters/Bridges
#### Description
- Develop adapters or bridges to integrate various serverless endpoints into the main application.
- Support endpoints like LLama.cpp, testcontainers, Runpod, and Hugging Face API for serverless operations.

#### Design Considerations
- **Unified Interface**: Create a common interface or abstract class for consistency.
- **Configuration Management**: Securely handle different endpoints and their credentials.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement robust logging and monitoring for each endpoint.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling to manage failures gracefully.
- **Performance Optimization**: Evaluate latency and throughput of each endpoint.
- **Security**: Implement strong security measures for data protection.

### Next Steps
- Develop unit tests to prototype basic LLama.cpp functionality.
- Verify chat completion and text generation using LLama.cpp.
- Configure Serilog for colorful logging output.
- Set up configuration management using `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`.
- Integrate MediatR for a robust event system.
- Document and refine the case study generation pipeline.
- Implement and test various inference endpoint adapters/bridges.
- Explore additional features like ethical decision-making simulations, advanced model evaluation, and scenario customization to enhance user engagement and model performance.
- Collaborate with educational institutions and research organizations to enrich the dataset and develop new use cases.
- Continue gathering feedback from users and the community to iteratively improve the project.
