Got it! Let's adjust our roadmap for 1-week sprints and expand Phase 3 to make it more manageable.

# Roadmap

## Project Roadmap

This document outlines the future plans, features, and milestones for the "Dark Thoughts" thinking-dataset project. The roadmap is designed to guide the project's development and ensure continuous improvement.

## Milestones

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Configuration (1 week)
- **Project Initialization**
  - [x] Create and configure the project directory.
  - [x] Set up version control using Git.
- **Environment Setup**
  - [x] Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.
  - [x] Configure environment variables using `.env` file.
- **Initial Documentation**
  - [x] Create essential documentation files: README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE.md.

### Phase 2: Data Pipeline Development (1 week)
- **Raw Data Ingestion**
  - [x] Collect initial raw data from various sources.
  - [x] Store raw data in a structured format using SQLite.
- **Data Preprocessing**
  - [x] Implement data cleaning methods to remove duplicates and handle missing values.
  - [x] Normalize and transform data into a standardized format.
- **Seed Generation**
  - [x] Define and generate seed objects using predefined keywords.

### Phase 3: Data Enrichment and Case Study Creation (3 weeks)
- **Week 1: Cable Creation**
  - [ ] Combine multiple seed objects to generate synthetic cable seeds using knowledge from source cables.
- **Week 2: Persona Database**
  - [ ] Generate and store stakeholder personas using the personas dataset on Hugging Face.
- **Week 3: Synthetic SitRep Generation and Case Study Creation**
  - [ ] Generate synthetic Situation Reports (SitReps) inspired by a couple of random seed objects.
  - [ ] Distribute SitReps to various imaginary stakeholders.
  - [ ] Use the stakeholder personas and SitReps to generate detailed case studies.
  - [ ] Enrich case studies with a chain of thoughts for use in Self-Teaching with Reinforcement (STaR) in Phase 4.

### Phase 4: Critic Agents and Evaluation (1 week)
- **Critic Agents Implementation**
  - [ ] Create critic agents to evaluate the case studies.
  - [ ] Evaluate case studies based on benchmarks and provide feedback.
- **Research and Improvement**
  - [ ] Use benchmarks to drive research and improve case studies through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).

### Phase 5: Model Training and Evaluation (1 week)
- **Dataset Preparation**
  - [ ] Validate data integrity and balance classes.
  - [ ] Split data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**
  - [ ] Train baseline models using the prepared dataset.
  - [ ] Fine-tune models for improved performance.
- **Evaluation System Development**
  - [ ] Implement an evaluation system to score models.
  - [ ] Compare fine-tuned models against baseline models.

### Phase 6: Inference Endpoint Adapters/Bridges (1 week)
- **Unified Interface**
  - [ ] Create a common interface or abstract class for adapters.
- **Adapter Implementations**
  - [ ] Develop concrete implementations for various endpoints (Ollama, testcontainers, Runpod, Hugging Face API).
- **Integration**
  - [ ] Seamlessly integrate adapters into the main application.

### Phase 7: Continuous Improvement (1 week)
- **Feedback Loop**
  - [ ] Gather user and system feedback to iteratively refine the dataset and models.
- **Documentation**
  - [ ] Maintain comprehensive documentation of methods, changes, and updates.
- **Community Engagement**
  - [ ] Engage with the community for contributions and collaboration.
  - [ ] Open issues and pull requests for enhancements.

### Future Features and Enhancements
- **Enhanced Scenario Development**
  - [ ] Develop more complex and diverse hypothetical scenarios.
  - [ ] Include multi-layered strategic dilemmas and cognitive biases.
- **Advanced Model Evaluation**
  - [ ] Implement advanced metrics for model evaluation.
  - [ ] Develop benchmarking tools for comparing different models.
- **User Interaction Tools**
  - [ ] Create interactive tools for users to engage with scenarios and provide feedback.
  - [ ] Develop visualization tools for better understanding of decision-making processes.
